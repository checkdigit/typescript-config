### Introduction

This module contains the standard Check Digit Typescript configuration, along with our standard build tool `builder`.

### Typescript Configuration

- currently requires Node 20.11 or above.
- emits `esnext`, with the default libraries, to avoid down-leveling. It is intended that application spec tests pick
  up any issues with using newer features unavailable in a particular environment. Browsers and NodeJS are fast-moving
  targets, and can add language features at any time.
- uses the `module` type of `esnext`.
- all compiler options set for maximum strictness.

### Builder

`builder` is a command line tool that generates ESM modules from the Typescript source.
It is intended to be used when publishing a package to NPM, or to bundle a package for deployment.
It uses `tsc` for generating types, and `esbuild` for generating code.

**Note:** the `require` function will be defined as a global variable, to allow
dynamic `require`s by CommonJS submodules. This is not a problem for NodeJS, but will cause issues in a browser environment.

#### Options

- `--type` the type of output to generate. Defaults to `module` (ESM). Valid values are `module` or `types`.
- `--entryPoint` the entry point for the bundle, relative to the inDir. if not provided, the files in the inDir will
  be processed as individual unbundled files.
- `--inDir` the input source code directory.
- `--outDir` the output directory.
- `--outFile` the output file, relative to `--outDir`. This is provided for single-file bundles, along with `--entryPoint`.
- `--external` external modules to exclude from the bundle. Built-in `node` modules are automatically excluded.
  A wildcard `*` can be used to exclude multiple external modules.
- `--minify` whether to minify the output.
- `--sourceMap` whether to include inline sourcemap.

#### Examples

```
# build ESM .mjs files from Typescript source
npx builder --type=module --outDir=build-esm

# build single-file ESM .mjs bundle from Typescript source
npx builder --type=module --outDir=build-esm-bundle --entryPoint=index.ts --outFile=index.mjs
```

### Tests

This module includes a number of integration-style tests, to ensure that a specific version of Typescript will interoperate
with `builder`, in addition to libraries and frameworks used by Check Digit:

- Jest and `ts-jest`
- ESLint and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- Built-in `node:test` runner
- prettier
- tsc
- esbuild

We do this to ensure that Typescript upgrades do not break these dependencies. New major versions of Typescript are not immediately
supported by projects such as ts-jest, eslint, prettier, etc. Our policy is to wait until these projects fully support
the new version of Typescript, and/or without emitting warnings during these tests, before publishing.

### A note about versioning

Strict semver is a little complicated, as Typescript itself does not adhere to semver. So our "best effort" policy is:

- Each update to the minimum Node target (e.g., Node 18 to Node 20), or a change to a major compiler output option
  (e.g. `module`, `target` or `moduleResolution`) will result in a new major version of this module.
  We coordinate this with whatever the latest LTS version of Node is currently supported by Amazon Lambda,
  Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions.
- Each new "major" version of Typescript (e.g. `4.2.x` to `4.3.x`) will result in a new minor version of this module.
- A new minor update of Typescript (e.g. `4.3.1` to `4.3.2`) _may_ result in a patch, in
  a situation where a specific need or issue requires setting a new minimum version of Typescript.

Bear in mind, any update of Typescript can potentially break your build. But hopefully in a way that's useful.

### Installation

```
npm add -D @checkdigit/typescript-config
```

Note: you do not need to explicitly install Typescript itself, as the most recent supported version comes in as a
peer dependency of `@checkdigit/typescript-config`.

Make sure your project's `tsconfig.json` extends `@checkdigit/typescript-config`.

### Example `tsconfig.json`

```
{
  "extends": "@checkdigit/typescript-config"
}
```

Note this configuration has `moduleResolution` set to `bundler`. This requires that you use the `builder` command
to produce working code for deployment. However, for simply running Jest tests, this is not necessary if
used in conjunction with [`@checkdigit/jest-config`](https://github.com/checkdigit/jest-config).
